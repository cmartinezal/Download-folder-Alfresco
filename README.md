# Download folder from Alfresco

## About The Project

The Alfresco Folder Downloader is a project that enables users to download folders from Alfresco, a popular open-source content management system, using both the CMIS (Content Management Interoperability Services) and REST API. The project provides a convenient and efficient way to retrieve complete folders with all their contents, including files, subfolders, and metadata.

## Getting Started

Let's start to use this project!

In the project folder, you will find a Python file containing the code for the application, a package of functions called utils, along with a customizable JSON config file. The Python file serves as the main script, containing the logic and functionality of the application. The JSON config file, on the other hand, allows you to customize and configure your personal Alfresco settings.

By adding your personal Alfresco configuration to the config file, you can tailor the application to seamlessly integrate with your existing Alfresco environment. This ensures that the application functions in harmony with your preferred settings and preferences.

### Prerequisites

Python 3 must be installed. Next, you can navigate to the config file to personalize your Alfresco configuration.

### Installation

To execute the project open the terminal and go to the project folder. Then execute it with python:

```sh
python3 download_folder_alfresco.py
```
